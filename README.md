# F1NextRace
My first web project using Spring Boot and Angular, work in progress <br>
Technologies used:
Java; Spring Boot; Typescript; Angular; HTML/CSS; Bootstrap; Docker; MS Azure

The first usable working version has been now finished!
To boot it up, you need to have the following software installed on your computer: <br>
-Java JDK 17 <br>
-Angular <br>
-there might be something else that I'm forgetting <br>

The F1NextRace/ folder contains the backend of the app which is a Java application built using Spring Boot framework. <br>
The F1NextRaceApp/ folder contains the frontend of the app built usign HTML, CSS and Typescript all strapped together using Angular. <br>

To start the backend you need to start the Java application from the startpoint class which is located in <code>F1NextRace\src\main\java\com\JordanParviainen\F1NextRace\F1NextRaceApplication.java</code> <br>
To start the frontend you need to start the Angular application by entering the project directory in the terminal and then running <code>ng serve</code><br>
After these steps, the app should be up and running at localhost:4200
