# F1NextRace
My first web project using Spring Boot and Angular, work in progress

The first usable working version has been now finished!
To boot it up, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:
-Java JDK 17 <br>
-Angular
-there might be something else that I'm forgetting

The F1NextRace/ folder contains the backend of the app which is a Java application built using Spring Boot framework.
The F1NextRaceApp/ folder contains the frontend of the app built usign HTML, CSS and Typescript all strapped together using Angular.

To start the backend you need to start the Java application from the startpoint class which is located in F1NextRace\src\main\java\com\JordanParviainen\F1NextRace\F1NextRaceApplication.java
To start the frontend you need to start the Angular application by entering the project directory in the terminal and then running ng serve
After these steps, the app should be up and running at localhost:4200
